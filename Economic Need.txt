What I see is Economy
But should that be?
Why would I look at the economy?
This economy, so greatly in needâ€¦
Can I do anything to make it better?
Or have better reason to see me freed?
Mind bound to news of these struggles,
In deed I seek growth, resource & economic re
Son, I think you've got something there.

Any Reason for you to Seed?  What I share is mine to keep.
I will grow with you this Seed.  I trust we keep a common deed.
Growth projected outward, inward or left alone for those in need.
