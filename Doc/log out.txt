A window can be opened to reveal all of my documents on google docs.
Yet I still needed to login at some point to enable such a function.
Why require someone to login? It is duality put into an application.
So great then is the power to be able to log out of the application.
That needs to be coupled to email so that the user can restore data.
Emphasis then is upon the root discussion educating them to log out.
