Commandment forth: Technology shall not be used to modify innocent creatures

As technology does cast light as on or off sides of electrical mechanism, so does the individual see IT has positive and negative sides.  I say now brethren to that affect is non sense, but to see beyond positive & negative ones as one that the mechanism has both yielding positive in the positive side & negative in the dark side: noth, which is able to generate a claim to usability in either plane, that would not be feared toward any gain, but yet of the virtue that IT is not being used to modify innocent creatures.
