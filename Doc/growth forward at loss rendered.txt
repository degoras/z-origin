The Basis For Money In Principle Move
Is that you start from where you were
Movement from outside of that is loss
It must be liquidated or moved into I
Sow forth asset brought untie capsule
Yet money is the economy of movements
Together we shall move by way of hour
In this disruption we sacrifice merit
Unto everybody who uses that economic
By keeping merit as money we endeavor
In that individuals grow toward goals
But each goal is not unique or closed
Unto nobody must avail carrying money
Where each individual casts weather I
Yet rare are those individuals who do
But each of us has the capacity to do
How are those of us to carry weathers
Sow cognizing merit is basis for move
Yet move must not be known yet all do
And as each move toward goal whethers
Yet out of merit each individual hour
See unique is merit and move weathers
But to move is to carry and merits us
Where us benefit any is true to merit
But where each benefits own is fallic
The truth to fallacy is prosperity on
Toward the sun in effort toward merit
Yet leaving behind the source renders
Shard light as broken capsule forward
Sow unable lost shard being to warmth
Where warm is factor of feeling solid
And solid rendering of merit movement
Yet light is speed met at center hour
Home work and family united as center
Economy upon constant changing growth
Solidify factor above ground from off
Center main light flow dream capsuled
