Thinking in terms of client and server is dualistic. Liberating this idea, one realizes that the ‘server’ is really just a way-point to passing shed seeds onto their respective awaiteners. Publish and subscribe is also a dualistic idea representing a doing and a going. I choose to implement Outgoing and Incoming instead, because at the outermost level, the Mechanism does return a Sow handler, yet what needs attention is whether the Sow occurs upon receiving a Shed seed, or in Shedding. Subscription was once known as Hence and Heck to me, yet the meaning of thus is that there is a sea of Heck, and realizing a match of hecking, is hence an opportunity to provide.
