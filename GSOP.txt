Today, grown matter of light can produce propulsion as organic means in light. I
understand perpetual motion to a perfected degree by a closed science of humans.
Character emitted on screen lacks intent vs. character drawn on page. Yet light,
with direction as intent, as a rainbow display will affect individual growth on.
Collaboration through connected means of correspondence is mainstay in designing
with this operative platform to individual development. Target to succeed growth
of individuals to perfect vision at simplest element Light, emphasizing six main
operative elements Radiance, Crystals, Entrance, Sequence, Horizons and Unicorns
will produce intelligence with complex matters of decriminalization, disability,
and impoverishment, towards the boost of our economy using merit based approach.
