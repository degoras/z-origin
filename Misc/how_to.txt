on socket connect, establish identity with registrar
for each socket, create application hooks
create additional application specific heck (subscription)
upon publishing to a radius-defined location, find set of sockets and match them with heck
then with hecked sockets call application hook

me.us.on hook is on the server side, but the client specifies it with a choice at a time
subscription exists that way on server side

my hook exists as a specifier kept on client and server sides
when an evoker matches the subscription, event matter is shed
objects sent over socket are appropriate to the hook and a my
in order for full duplex transmission to work the evokers and
the shards come as different functions that match accordingly
